                <h4>Definition:</h4>
                <p>The transmission rate, β (beta), represents the rate at which an infectious individual generates new infections in a susceptible population per unit of time.</p>
                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>It's a coefficient quantifying the effective transmission probability between an infectious and a susceptible individual. It typically combines two main factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contact rate (k or c):</strong> The average number of contacts an individual has per unit of time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Probability of transmission per contact (p):</strong> The likelihood that a contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual results in a new infection.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Medical/Epidemiological Relevance:</h4>
                <p>A high β indicates the disease spreads easily. Interventions like social distancing, mask use, or improved ventilation aim to reduce the contact rate (k) or transmission probability (p), thereby reducing β.</p>
                <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
                <p>Conceptually:</p>
                <code class="formula">β = k × p</code>
                <p>In SIR models, β is a key input parameter determining how quickly susceptibles become infected.</p>

            <div id="dContent" class="parameter-content">
                <h4>Definition:</h4>
                <p>The duration of the infectious period (D) is the average time an infected individual can transmit the disease to others.</p>
                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>It represents the window of opportunity for transmission from a single case. A longer infectious period means more time to generate secondary cases.</p>
                <h4>Medical/Epidemiological Relevance:</h4>
                <p>Varies greatly among diseases. Influenza has a short D (few days), while untreated tuberculosis can have a very long D. Treatments can shorten D for some diseases.</p>
                <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
                <p>D is a direct parameter. Its inverse is the recovery rate (γ).</p>

            <div id="gammaContent" class="parameter-content">
                <h4>Definition:</h4>
                <p>The recovery rate, γ (gamma), is the rate at which infectious individuals cease to be infectious, either by recovering and developing immunity, or by being otherwise removed from the transmission process (e.g., isolation, death).</p>
                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>It is the inverse of the average duration of the infectious period (D).</p>
                <h4>Medical/Epidemiological Relevance:</h4>
                <p>A high γ means individuals recover (or cease to be infectious) quickly, reducing the time available for them to transmit. The natural history of the disease and treatment efficacy influence γ.</p>
                <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
                <code class="formula">γ = 1 / D</code>
                <p>Where D is the average duration of the infectious period.</p>

            </button>
            <div id="lambdaContent" class="parameter-content">
                <h4>Definition:</h4>
                <p>The Force of Infection, λ (lambda), is the per capita rate at which susceptible individuals acquire infection. It represents the risk or hazard for a susceptible individual to become infected at any given point in time.</p>
                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>It quantifies how "infectious" the environment or population is to a susceptible person. It depends on the prevalence of infection and the transmission rate.</p>
                <h4>Medical/Epidemiological Relevance:</h4>
                <p>A higher force of infection means a higher risk for susceptibles. Public health measures aim to reduce λ by reducing the number of infectious individuals (I) or the transmission efficiency (β).</p>
                <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
                <p>In a homogeneously mixing population (like in a simple SIR model):</p>
                <code class="formula">λ = (β × I) / N</code>
                <p>Where β is the transmission rate, I is the number of infectious individuals, and N is the total population size.</p>

            </button>
            <div id="r0Content" class="parameter-content">
                <h4>Definition:</h4>
                <p>The Basic Reproduction Number (R₀, "R-nought") is the average number of secondary infections produced by a single typical infectious individual introduced into a population where everyone is susceptible.</p>
                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>R₀ measures the intrinsic transmissibility of an infectious agent in a naive population without control interventions. It's a critical threshold:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If R₀ > 1: The infection can invade and spread.</li>
                    <li>If R₀ = 1: The infection may persist (become endemic) but not grow exponentially.</li>
                    <li>If R₀ < 1: The infection will likely die out.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Medical/Epidemiological Relevance:</h4>
                <p>Highly contagious diseases like measles have high R₀ (e.g., 12-18). Knowing R₀ helps estimate outbreak potential and control effort needed (e.g., vaccination coverage).</p>
                <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
                <p>For a simple SIR model:</p>
                <code class="formula">R₀ = β / γ</code>
                <p>Conceptually:</p>
                <code class="formula">R₀ = (Transmission probability per contact) × (Contact rate) × (Duration of infectiousness)</code>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Proportion of Susceptibles (s) -->
            <button class="parameter-button" onclick="toggleParameter('sFractionContent')">
                <span>Proportion of Susceptibles (s)</span>
                <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
            </button>
            <div id="sFractionContent" class="parameter-content">
                <h4>Definition:</h4>
                <p>The proportion of susceptibles (s) is the fraction of the total population that lacks immunity to a specific infectious agent and can therefore contract the disease upon exposure.</p>
                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>At the start of an epidemic with a novel pathogen, 's' is close to 1 (or 100%). As the epidemic progresses and more individuals become infected and recover (or are vaccinated), 's' decreases. This parameter is crucial for understanding the transition from R₀ to Rₑ.</p>
                <h4>Medical/Epidemiological Relevance:</h4>
                <p>Herd immunity is achieved when 's' has decreased sufficiently so that transmission cannot be sustained (i.e., Rₑ < 1). Vaccination campaigns aim to reduce 's' artificially.</p>
                <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
                <code class="formula">s = S / N</code>
                <p>Where S is the number of susceptible individuals and N is the total population.</p>

            </button>
            <div id="reContent" class="parameter-content">
                <h4>Definition:</h4>
                <p>The Effective Reproduction Number (Rₑ, or Rₜ at time t) is the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individual in a population at a specific time, considering existing immunity and active control interventions.</p>
                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>Rₑ reflects the actual transmissibility of the disease at a given moment, unlike R₀ which is a theoretical potential. It's a dynamic indicator:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If Rₑ > 1: The epidemic is growing.</li>
                    <li>If Rₑ = 1: The epidemic is at a plateau (stable).</li>
                    <li>If Rₑ < 1: The epidemic is declining.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Medical/Epidemiological Relevance:</h4>
                <p>Rₑ is closely monitored by public health authorities to assess the effectiveness of control measures. The goal is to reduce and maintain Rₑ < 1.</p>
                <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
                <code class="formula">Rₑ = R₀ × s</code>

            <div id="incubContent" class="parameter-content">
                <h4>Definition:</h4>
                <p>The incubation period is the time elapsed between exposure to a pathogenic organism and when symptoms and signs are first apparent.</p>
                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>During this period, an individual is infected but not yet clinically identifiable as a case (and may or may not be infectious, depending on the disease). In models, this leads to an 'E' (Exposed) compartment (SEIR models).</p>
                <h4>Medical/Epidemiological Relevance:</h4>
                <p>Knowing the incubation period is crucial for quarantine durations, contact tracing, and understanding reporting delays.</p>
                <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
                <p>If T<sub>inc</sub> is the average incubation period, the rate of progression from Exposed (E) to Infectious (I) is often denoted σ (sigma) or α (alpha):</p>

                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>It reflects the speed at which an infection spreads from one generation of cases to the next. It's a fundamental timescale of epidemic spread.</p>
                <h4>Medical/Epidemiological Relevance:</h4>
                <p>A shorter generation time implies faster epidemic growth. It's related to R₀ and the epidemic growth rate. It can be difficult to measure directly as it relies on knowing who infected whom and when.</p>
                <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
                <p>There isn't a single simple formula; it's often estimated from data or derived from models. Conceptually, for simple models, it's related to the duration of infectiousness and the timing of peak infectivity.</p>

                <h4>Theoretical Meaning:</h4>
                <p>It's an observable proxy for the generation time, as symptom onset is usually easier to identify than the exact moment of infection. It's used to estimate how quickly an epidemic is spreading.</p>

                <h3>Introduction to the SIR Model</h3>
                <p>The SIR model is a foundational compartmental model in epidemiology. It divides the population into three distinct groups based on their disease status:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>S (Susceptible):</strong> Individuals who can contract the disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>I (Infectious):</strong> Individuals currently infected and capable of transmitting the disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>R (Recovered/Removed):</strong> Individuals who have recovered (and are assumed immune) or have been removed from the transmission process (e.g., through death or isolation).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The model uses a system of differential equations to describe how the number of individuals in each compartment changes over time.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: From Susceptible to Infected (S → I)</h3>
                <p>Susceptible individuals become infected through contact with infectious individuals. The rate of new infections depends on the number of susceptibles, the number of infectious individuals, and how effectively the disease transmits.</p>

                <p>The rate of change for susceptibles (dS/dt) is negative because their numbers decrease as they get infected. This is governed by the <span class="equation-highlight">Force of Infection (λ)</span>, which is the per capita rate at which susceptibles acquire infection.</p>

                <code class="equation">dS/dt = -λ × S</code>

                <code class="equation">λ = (β × I) / N</code>
                <p>So, substituting λ, the equation becomes:</p>

                <h3>Model Inputs and Outputs</h3>
                <p>The primary **INPUTS** to this simple SIR model are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The parameters <span class="equation-highlight">β</span> (transmission rate) and <span class="equation-highlight">γ</span> (recovery rate).</li>
                    <li>The initial conditions: S(0), I(0), R(0) (the number of individuals in each compartment at time t=0).</li>
                    <li>The total population size N (often assumed constant).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The **OUTPUTS** of the model are the time-series S(t), I(t), and R(t), which show the number of individuals in each compartment over time, effectively describing the epidemic curve.</p>
                <p>The <span class="equation-highlight">Basic Reproduction Number (R₀ = β/γ)</span> is a crucial emergent property derived from the input parameters. It determines if an epidemic will occur (if R₀ > 1) when S ≈ N.</p>

                <h3>Modeling Vector-Transmitted Infections</h3>
                <p>Diseases like dengue, malaria, Zika, and Chikungunya are transmitted by vectors (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks). Modeling these requires parameters for both the human host and the vector population, as well as their interaction.</p>
                <p>Common parameters include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Extrinsic Incubation Period (EIP or 1/ε):</strong> Time for the pathogen to develop in the vector before it can be transmitted. Highly temperature-dependent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vectorial Capacity (C):</strong> A composite measure of a vector population's efficiency in transmitting a pathogen. It includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>m:</strong> Vector density relative to hosts.</li>
                            <li><strong>a:</strong> Vector biting rate on hosts per day.</li>
                            <li><strong>b:</strong> Probability of pathogen transmission from infectious host to susceptible vector per bite.</li>
                            <li><strong>c:</strong> Probability of pathogen transmission from infectious vector to susceptible host per bite.</li>
                            <li><strong>P:</strong> Daily survival probability of the vector.</li>
                            <li><strong>n or 1/ε:</strong> Duration of EIP in days.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Vector Longevity:</strong> Average lifespan of the vector. The vector must live longer than the EIP to transmit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intrinsic Incubation Period (in humans, 1/σ<sub>h</sub>):</strong> Time from infectious bite to symptom onset/infectiousness in humans.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Models often have separate compartments for susceptible, exposed, and infectious stages for both humans (S<sub>h</sub>, E<sub>h</sub>, I<sub>h</sub>, R<sub>h</sub>) and vectors (S<sub>v</sub>, E<sub>v</sub>, I<sub>v</sub>).</p>

                <h3>Expanding Complexity and Realism</h3>
                <p>While the SIR model is foundational, real-world disease dynamics often require more complex models:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SEIR Models:</strong> Add an 'E' (Exposed) compartment for individuals infected but not yet infectious (accounting for the incubation period).</li>
                    <li><strong>Models with Vital Dynamics:</strong> Include births and deaths, important for long-term endemic diseases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Models with Waning Immunity (e.g., SIRS, SEIRS):</strong> Allow recovered individuals (R) to return to susceptible (S) after some time, relevant for diseases where immunity is not lifelong.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stochastic Models (e.g., Markov Chain Models):</strong> Instead of deterministic changes, these models incorporate probability and chance for individual events (infection, recovery). Crucial for small populations or early outbreak dynamics to assess extinction probability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agent-Based Models (ABM):</strong> Simulate individual "agents" with unique characteristics and behaviors interacting in an environment. Allows for explicit modeling of population heterogeneity, social networks, and spatial spread. Computationally intensive but can provide detailed insights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Models:</strong> Focus on the structure of contact networks between individuals and how this structure influences disease spread.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The choice of model depends on the specific research question, available data, and the desired level of detail.</p>
